# Coinlore-Crypto-API-Assignment

In our assignment, we were tasked to create a Apollo Graphql API using Coinlore Crypto API which consisted of:

 - A GraphQL API wrapping around the https://api.coinlore.net/api/global/  REST API
 - GraphQL API Query that resolves all Coins from https://api.coinlore.net/api/tickers/
 - GraphQL API Query that resolves market data for a given Coin from https://api.coinlore.net/api/coin/markets/?id=90

Important packages to install when running:

 - Axios package: npm i axios --save
 - Apollo Server: npm install apollo-server graphql
 - Apollo Datasource Rest: npm install apollo-datasource-rest
